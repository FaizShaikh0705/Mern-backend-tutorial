# NodeJs+ExpressJs CRUD Project

This Node.js project implements a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, demonstrating the use of Node.js in building RESTful APIs. The project structure is organized and modular, making it easy to understand and modify.

## Project Structure

- `controllers/`: Contains controller files managing the logic for various CRUD operations.
- `routes/`: Contains routers which navigates the request to particular controllers.
- `db.json`: Acts as a mock database or a configuration file for storing data.
- `helper.js`: Provides utility functions or helper methods used across the project.
- `index.js`: The main entry point of the application.
- `package.json`: Contains metadata about the project, such as dependencies and scripts.

## Getting Started

### Running the Application

1. Open the project directory in the terminal and run `npm install` command to install all the required packages.
2. Start the server by running `npm start` in the terminal.
3. The server will start, and you can interact with the API using a tool like Postman..

## Usage

- The routes and their corresponding functionalities can be tested using API testing tools like Postman.
- Perform CRUD operations on data stored in `db.json`.
